    <h1>Absolute Position Property</h1>
    <p>
      An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest
      positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like
      fixed).
    </p>
    <p>
      However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it
      uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can
      overlap elements.
    </p>
